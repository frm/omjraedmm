# OMJRAEDMM

The electronics store across the street had a everything-20%-off day.

Instead of fighting for those sweet discounts, being the smarty pants I am, I
decided to purchase from the online store which began the sale during the
previous night. And I chose the option of store delivery, thinking I could just
waltz in the store the very next day while everyone else was knocking their
teeth off and walk away with the items.

Now, I waltzed in and the items were indeed in stock. But I was told they
couldn't provide them since it was a discount sale. "Fair enough", I thought. "I
can just wait for the next day and take them if they're in stock".

Next day I again went to the store, the items were indeed in stock, but I still
couldn't get them. "It has to be from the online store stock, not our actual
stock".

So instead of having a thunderous victory walk out of the store while everyone
was fighting for their discounts, here I am, a week later and I still haven't
received my items.

My never-ending wait has, of course, become a running joke. To honor the memes,
I hacked (code-hammered) an outgoing webhook during a lunch break to check my
order status.

Some day my order will get here. But that day is not today.
